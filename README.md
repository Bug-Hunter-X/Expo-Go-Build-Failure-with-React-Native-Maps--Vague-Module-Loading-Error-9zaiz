# Expo Go Build Failure with React-Native-Maps: Vague Module Loading Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo's managed workflow with the `react-native-maps` library.  Local builds succeed, but attempts to build and run the application on a physical device using Expo Go result in a vague module loading error.  The solution involves a specific configuration change within the Expo project.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Attempt to run the app on a physical device using Expo Go.  Observe the error.
5. Review the `bugSolution.js` file to see the solution.

## Solution

The solution is described in detail in the `bugSolution.js` file. It primarily focuses on ensuring that all required native modules are properly linked and configured for compatibility with Expo Go.
