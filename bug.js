While building an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's managed workflow and a third-party library.  Specifically, after integrating the library, the app would build successfully on my local machine, but would fail during the build process on Expo Go on the device. The error message was vague, mentioning a general failure to load a module, and didn't provide much context for debugging. The library in question, `react-native-maps`, was correctly installed and linked, and the configuration followed the documentation closely. I tried reinstalling the library, cleaning the project cache, and restarting Expo Go, but nothing resolved the issue.
